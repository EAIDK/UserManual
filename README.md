EAIDK(Embedded AI Development Kit) is an AI Development Kit for edge computing and designed for AI developers.The hardware platform has the ability to collect data from Audio and Video Sensors, and have motion control interface for multi-scene.The intelligent software platform can support many applications such as visual processing and analysis, speech recognition, semantic analysis, SLAM and so on, and support many open source algorithms. EAIDK can satisfy the requirement of AI education, application development, product development and verification.         
Eai610-p0 is the first hardware platform in EAIDK. The main chip is RK3399 and installed with embedded AI development platform AID including HCL(Heterogeneous Computing Library),Tengine(Deep Learning Inference Framework) and BladeCV(lightweight embedded computer vision acceleration library).It can provide concise, efficient and unified API interface for AI application, and accelerates the implementation of AI application.

There are some docs and srcs for EAIDK which for video collection and other application guide.
